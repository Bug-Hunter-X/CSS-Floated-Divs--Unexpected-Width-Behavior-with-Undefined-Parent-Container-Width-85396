To fix this issue, ensure that the parent container has a defined width. This can be done by setting a fixed width (e.g., `width: 1000px;`), a percentage width (e.g., `width: 100%;`), or using other layout techniques such as flexbox or grid.

Here's an example using a percentage width for the parent container:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
}
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
  box-sizing: border-box; /*This ensures that padding and border are included in the element's total width and height*/
}
```

Using flexbox:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /*This ensures that padding and border are included in the element's total width and height*/
}
```
