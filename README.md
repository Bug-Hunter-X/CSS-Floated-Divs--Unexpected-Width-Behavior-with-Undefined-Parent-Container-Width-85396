# CSS Floated Divs: Unexpected Width Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the behavior of floated divs in CSS when their parent container does not have an explicitly defined width.  In some browsers, this can lead to unexpected rendering, where the divs do not occupy the expected 50% of the available space. 

The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates a solution. The issue is described in `bug.md`.

This is a subtle bug that can be difficult to track down, particularly in more complex layouts. This example provides a concise illustration of the problem and a simple solution.
